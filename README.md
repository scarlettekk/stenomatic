Stenomatic is an open source stenotype keyboard designed for an elegant yet inexpensive typing experience. This repository hosts all the files and information needed to produce one, which anyone can do for their own use. You may use your Stenomatic for any purpose you like, but you may not produce Stenomatics for the express purpose of selling them.

*Note: Photos of the keyboard in this document are of v2.0, when the Left S and * keys were rotated incorrectly, hence they only had 1u keycaps. This is fixed in the current version and 2u keycaps can be used.*

Stenomatic uses [Kailh Choc Pink switches](https://www.kailhswitch.com/mechanical-keyboard-switches/choc-pro-pink-keyboard-switch.html) for the most similar experience to a professional stenotype machine.
